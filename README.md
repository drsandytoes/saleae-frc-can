## About
This project is a custom "high-level" analyzer for the Saleae family of 
protocol analyzers (https://www.saleae.com). It sits on top of the built-in 
low-level CAN analyzer and adds additional decoding of CAN frames that adhere
to the First Robotics Competition (FRC) specification as described here:
